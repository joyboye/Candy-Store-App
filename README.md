# Candy-Store-App
homework on how to build a candy store app.
I created a new project, delected the old migration and added a new migration, migration is a C# code that goes into sql to create tables, column and row, then i create a class for candy, store and manufacturer that linked the three table with their foreign keys then scaffolded the three classes and connect to the local server.
